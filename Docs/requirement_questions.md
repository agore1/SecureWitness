Questions/Clarifications
------------------------
  * What hardware will be available for us to host the server?
  * What size and types of files are we storing?
  * If someone joins a group after a key is already distributed, do they automatically get the key?
  * What things can admins do with user accounts?
  * How does one become an admin? What relationship does the admin have with groups? Are    admins able to access every group on “the system”, or just specific groups. 
  * Are we hosting the system or are we just providing the software?
  * Is there overlap between the three roles? Can admins be readers?
  * Can multiple authors store files in the same folder? How does copying these folders work? Who can do it?
  * What are the standard fields for a report? 
  * Are private files hidden/visible in search results of non-owners? 
  * How do non-administrators go about creating a group?
  * How do folders affect the reader’s experience? Can they search for folders as well as documents?
  * Are private files and encrypted files necessarily related?
